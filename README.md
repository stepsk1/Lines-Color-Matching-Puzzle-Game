# Mini Game "Lines"

Developed a C# mini-game where players
connect 5+ balls of the same color to score points
and compete locally.
Implemented Factory and Singleton patterns to
ensure robust database interactions and seamless
connections.
Utilized BFS algorithm for pathfinding, integrated
a clock for strategic gameplay, and added subtle
sound effects for an immersive experience.
